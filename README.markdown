CWAC Layouts: Custom Containers, Concisely Coded
================================================

This project has a handful
of Android containers (`ViewGroup` implementations) designed to handle
specific scenarios: 

- `AspectLockedFrameLayout` that resizes itself, and its children, to
fit within a specific aspect ratio

- `MirroringFrameLayout` and an associated `Mirror` that duplicates and
scales the contents of the `MirroringFrameLayout` onto the `Mirror`

This Android library project is 
[available as a JAR](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-layouts/releases)
or as an artifact for use with Gradle. To use that, add the following
blocks to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://s3.amazonaws.com/repo.commonsware.com"
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.commonsware.cwac:layouts:0.4.5'
}
```

Or, if you cannot use SSL, use `http://repo.commonsware.com` for the repository
URL.

**NOTE**: The JAR name, as of v0.4.1, has a `cwac-` prefix, to help distinguish it from other JARs.

Usage: AspectLockedFrameLayout
------------------------------
`AspectLockedFrameLayout` inherits from `FrameLayout`, and so you start by
setting it up much like you would any other `FrameLayout`. In fact, if you do
nothing else, it behaves the same as a regular `FrameLayout`.

However, if you call `setAspectRatio()` (supplying a `double` of the aspect
ratio you want) or `setAspectRatioSource()` (supplying a `View` whose aspect
ratio should be matched), then `AspectLockedFrameLayout` will reduce its height
or width to maintain the requested aspect ratio. This affects the children of
the `AspectLockedFrameLayout` as well, of course.

Since the `AspectLockedFrameLayout` effectively overrides and reduces its size,
you can use `android:layout_gravity` to position the shrunken
`AspectLockedFrameLayout` within its parent:

```xml
<FrameLayout
	android:layout_width="match_parent"
	android:layout_height="match_parent">

	<com.commonsware.cwac.layouts.AspectLockedFrameLayout
		android:id="@+id/source"
		android:layout_width="match_parent"
		android:layout_height="match_parent"
		android:layout_gravity="center">

		<!-- children go here -->
	</com.commonsware.cwac.layouts.AspectLockedFrameLayout>
</FrameLayout>
```

Note that the resizing only takes place when the `AspectLockedFrameLayout`
is measured. If you change the aspect ratio, call `requestLayout()` on
the `AspectLockedFrameLayout` (or any parent container) to get it to resize.

**NOTE**: `ConstraintLayout` also offers aspect ratio control, so you might
consider using it if it better fits your needs.

Usage: Mirroing
---------------
The mirror classes are specifically designed for use with Android's
`Presentation` class, specifically for actual presentations. In a presentation,
the presenter needs to be able to see and control some widgets, but the
audience simply needs to see the widgets via a projector or other external
display. `MirroringFrameLayout`, used as a container around the control
widgets, will clone its output onto the `Mirror` `View`, which in turn
can be hosted by a `Presentation`.

To mirror a widget or widget hierarchy, wrap it in a `com.commonsware.cwac.layouts.MirroringFrameLayout`:

```xml
<com.commonsware.cwac.layouts.MirroringFrameLayout
	android:id="@+id/source"
	android:layout_width="1000px"
	android:layout_height="0dp"
	android:layout_weight="1"
	android:background="#88FF0000">

	<WebView
	android:id="@+id/webkit"
	android:layout_width="match_parent"
	android:layout_height="match_parent"/>

</com.commonsware.cwac.layouts.MirroringFrameLayout>
```

Also add a `com.commonsware.cwac.layouts.Mirror` widget where you want the duplicate
contents to be rendered.

Then, in your Java code, attach the `Mirror` to the `MirroringFrameLayout`:

```java
MirroringFrameLayout source=
    (MirroringFrameLayout)findViewById(R.id.source);
Mirror target=(Mirror)findViewById(R.id.target);

source.setMirror(target);
```

And that's it.

This should work for all widgets except `SurfaceView` and `TextureView`, plus
things derived from them (e.g., `VideoView`, Maps V2 `MapView`).

Note that `MirroringFrameLayout` inherits from `AspectLockedFrameLayout` and sets its
aspect ratio to match that of the `Mirror`. This ensures that the `Mirror` will be
filled without some type of anamorphic stretching.

You are welcome to implement the `MirrorSink` interface on something and use that
as the destination for the mirroring, rather than use a `Mirror`.

JavaDocs
--------
An API reference, in the form of JavaDocs, is available [online](http://javadocs.commonsware.com/cwac/layouts/index.html).

Dependencies
------------
This project has no dependencies and should work on most versions of Android, though
it is only being tested on API Level 8+.

Version
-------
This is version v0.4.5 of this module, meaning it is coming along nicely.

Demo
----
In the `demo/` sub-project you will find
a `SimpleMirrorActivity` activity and a `WebMirrorActivity` that each
demonstrates the use of `MirroringFrameLayout` and `Mirror`.
